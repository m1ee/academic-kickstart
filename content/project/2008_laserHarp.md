A laser harp is an electronic musical instrument consisting of several laser beams to be blocked, in analogy with the plucking of the strings of a harp, in order to produce sounds. Jean Michel Jarre popularized it in the early 90’s when he used it in his concerts. In this project, I made an Arduino based circuit that measures distance, calculates pitch and sends midi.

The “Laser Harp” differs from a conventional harp in that it has laser beams instead of strings. To play it you simply break the laser beams with your hands. Some earlier versions of this very instrument had laser beams so powerful that they burned the hands of the performers! We decided to make a little safer version with lasers that wouldn’t hurt us.
