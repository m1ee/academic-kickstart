Traditionally, an implementation of mixed reality systems requires tight and accurate spatial/visual registration between the objects from two worlds (e.g. real and virtual). “Loosely coupled Mixed Reality (LMR),” however, which uses only minimal explicit and technologically supported association cues between the real and virtual objects. Instead, through a metaphor between the virtual space and real operating environment, the burden of registration (fusing of the worlds) is put more on to the user.
