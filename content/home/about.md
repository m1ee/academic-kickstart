# Biography

Hi! I’m Myungho Lee, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. I am also a member of Synthetic Reality Lab, where I spend most of my time playing with cool VR/AR headsets as well as various positional/biometric tracking devices. Thanks to my advisor, Dr. Greg Welch, I’ve been able to get hands-on experiences on latest devices for VR/AR.

My recent research focuses on making a more realistic experience in interactions with virtual humans. Particularly I’m interested in inducing Physicality Illusion — making people feel virtual entities as real – for the non-physical virtual humans using shared objects in the shared environment with virtual humans. I am also interested in measuring/analyzing physiological/behavioral responses in VR/AR.

Before joining UCF, I was a member of Digital eXPerience Lab at Korea University, where I first exposed to VR/AR. During the time in KU, I worked on making devices for novel interaction techniques. I still like tinkering hardware.
