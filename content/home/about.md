# About me

Hi! I'm Myungho Lee.
I recently received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [University of Central Florida (UCF)](https://www.ucf.edu), under the supervision of [Prof. Greg Welch](https://sreal.ucf.edu/people/welch/), a co-director of [Synthetic Reality Lab (SREAL)](https://sreal.ucf.edu) at UCF.
I joined SREAL in 2012 as a graduate research assistant, where I got hands-on experiences with state-of-arts VR/AR headsets as well as positional/biometric tracking devices for research projects.

My recent research focuses on making a more realistic experience in interactions with virtual humans. Particularly I’m interested in inducing Physicality Illusion — making people feel virtual entities as real – for the non-physical virtual humans using shared objects in the shared environment with virtual humans. I am also interested in measuring/analyzing physiological/behavioral responses in VR/AR.

Before joining UCF, I was a member of [Digital eXPerience Lab](https://dxp.korea.ac.kr) at [Korea University (KU)](https://www.korea.edu/), where I first exposed to VR/AR. During the time in KU, I worked on making devices for novel interaction techniques. I still like tinkering hardware.
