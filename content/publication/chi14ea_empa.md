abstract = "We present a novel approach that allows the user to feel the other's emotional status while communicating with each other in a video chat. The video chat is composed of physiological sensors and multimodal displays. In our first prototype, we employed a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor and a Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) sensor as they were crucial indications to human emotions. A vibrotactile motor and a RGB LED were also used in order to convey and display the other's emotion on one's wrist. Along with the hardware part, we implemented intuitive software for processing, transmitting, and displaying bio feedback data."
