abstract = "We investigate the effect of vibrotactile feedback delivered to one's feet in an immersive virtual environment (IVE). In our study, participants observed a virtual environment where a virtual human (VH) walked toward the participants and paced back and forth within their social space. We compared three conditions as follows: participants in the *Sound* condition heard the footsteps of the VH; participants in the *Vibration* condition experienced the vibration of the footsteps along with the sounds; while participants in the *Mute* condition were not exposed to sound nor vibrotactile feedback. We found that the participants in the *Vibration* condition felt a higher social presence with the VH compared to those who did not feel the vibration. The participants in the *Vibration* condition also exhibited greater avoidance behavior while facing the VH and when the VH invaded their personal space."
